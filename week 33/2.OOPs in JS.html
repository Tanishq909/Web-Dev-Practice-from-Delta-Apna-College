    <h1><ul><u><b style="font-size: 3em;">OOPs in JS</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h1><ul><u><b>Object Prototypes</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h2>Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.</h2>
    <h2>It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having
        their own copy.</h2>
    <h2>
        arr.__proto__ (reference)                 <br>
        Array.prototype (actual object)         <br>
        String.prototype                        <br>
    </h2>
    <h2>Prototype methods have same memory location.</h2>
    <h2>Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is
        itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype
        chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has nult for its own prototype.</h2>

    <h1><ul><u><b>Factory Functions</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h2>A function that creates objects</h2>

    <h1><ul><u><b>New Operator</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h2>The new operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of built-in object types that has a constructor function.</h2>

    <h1><ul><u><b>Classes</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h2>Classes are a template for creating objects.</h2>
    <h2>The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.</h2>

    <h1><ul><u><b>Inheritance</b></u></ul></h1>
    <h2>Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes.</h2>
